[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/maielhadad99/Linear_Regression_Project.git)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

- **Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn

- **Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

- **Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in 73% accuracy .

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Prediction of user interest using bank data](https://github.com/maielhadad99/Logistic_Regression_Project..git)

<img src="images/bank image.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project you will be provided with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in 86% accuracy using Logistic Regression and SMOTE .

- in this project we are given real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
- The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://github.com/maielhadad99/Knn_Nb_Project.git)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib,KNN,NB

**Project Objective:** In this project we are provided with multiple instances of orthopedic parameters and we are also provided with their classification as Normal or Abnormal. We have to implement K Nearest Neighbour, the algorithm is used to classify points according to class of their K nearest neighbour points .

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the orthopedic parameters as Normal or Abnormal with an accuracy of 82% .

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

[TalkingData Project on Bagging and Boosting ensemble model:](https://github.com/maielhadad99/DT_Ensemble_Project.git)

<img src="images/Mobile.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib,XGboost Classifier, BaggingClassifier

**Project Objective:** In this problem, we will use the features associated with clicks, such as IP address, operating system, device type, time of click etc. to predict the probability of a click being fraud.

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the Pepole who downloaded the app after watching the advertisement  with an accuracy of 99% .

- Used the XGboost Classifier algorithm to classify the Pepole who downloaded the app after watching the advertisement and identify the click fraud
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a BaggingClassifier model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

[The San Francisco Project on Clustering](https://github.com/maielhadad99/Clustring_Project.git)

<img src="images/clusters.png?raw=true"/>


**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib,Elbow method, K means cluster algorithm

**Project Objective:** We have to fit the data to a clustering model. The model should help the State authorities/Policy makers to understand how they can improve on their policies for employee benefits.

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify 3 clusters from the dataset .

- Used the  K means cluster algorithm to classify the number of clusters the can be formed from the data
- Compared predictive performance by using  a elbow method to the data

[Amazon Fine Food Analysis using NLP](https://github.com/maielhadad99/NLP_Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews-Analysis_Naive_Bayes.git)

<img src="images/amazon.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, TfidVectorizer

**Project Objective:** Given a review, determine whether the review is positive or negative based on Amazon foods .

**Quantifiable result:** We could We could use the Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 could be cosnidered a positive review. A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is nuetral and ignored. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) 

[**AUC** Score of 88%](https://github.com/maielhadad99/NLP_Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews-Analysis_Naive_Bayes/blob/main/NLP_Amazon_Fine_Food_Reviews_Analysis_Naive_Bayes.ipynb) .
- Given a review, it is determined whether the review is positive or negative.
- Used NLP for this approach.
- A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is nuetral and ignored.
